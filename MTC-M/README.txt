This is the basic layout of our project. 

We split the work, right. 
So,     kmpl team - use kmpl.html
    sheddown team - use sheddown.html

For tyres, as discussed, we will do it in the last. 

The files end with .html now. 
It's fine. For now.

When we finish this project , all those .html files would become .php. (and it should)
